            There are many ways to build your own Linux distribution.
             But many of them are time consuming like Linux from scratch and you have to compile all the packages yourself.
              But in the RootFS method you do not need to compile all the packages. You are basically building a distribution
               or a derivative of existing distributions. This saves time.

          <h3 class="section__title">What is Linux File Systems</h3>
          <p>
            In this article we want to deal with the Linux file system.
             I have read an article in this area and I do not want to rewrite it because
              "<a href="https://opensource.com/users/dboth" style="color: crimson;">Mr.David Both</a>" has addressed this subject at "<a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/10/introduction-linux-filesystems" style="color: crimson;">opensource.com</a>". 
              Thanks to him, we want to share what he said.
          </p>
          <h4 class="section__title">Definitions</h4>
          <p>
            You may hear people talk about filesystems in a number of different and confusing ways. 
            The word itself can have multiple meanings, 
            and you may have to discern the correct meaning from the context of a discussion or document.
            I will attempt to define the various meanings of the word "filesystem" based 
            on how I have observed it being used in different circumstances. Note that while attempting to conform to standard 
            "official" meanings, my intent is to define the term based on its various usages.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. The entire Linux directory structure starting at the top (/) root directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. A specific type of data storage format, such as EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS, and so on. 
            Linux supports almost 100 types of filesystems, including some very old ones as well as some of the newest. 
            Each of these filesystem types uses its own metadata structures to define how the data is stored and accessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. A partition or logical volume formatted with a specific type of 
            filesystem that can be mounted on a specified mount point on a Linux filesystem.
          </p>

          <h4 class="section__title">Basic filesystem functions</h4>
          <p>
            Disk storage is a necessity that brings with it some interesting and inescapable details. Obviously,
             a filesystem is designed to provide space for non-volatile storage of data; that is its ultimate function. However,
             there are many other important functions that flow from that requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            All filesystems need to provide a namespace—that is, a naming and organizational methodology.
             This defines how a file can be named, specifically the length of a filename and the subset of characters
              that can be used for filenames out of the total set of characters available. It also defines the logical
               structure of the data on a disk, such as the use of directories for organizing files instead of just lumping
                them all together in a single, huge conglomeration of files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the namespace has been defined, a metadata structure is necessary to provide the logical foundation for that
             namespace. This includes the data structures required to support a hierarchical directory structure;
              structures to determine which blocks of space on the disk are used and which are available; structures
               that allow for maintaining the names of the files and directories; information about the files such as their
                size and times they were created, modified or last accessed; and the location or locations of the data belonging
                 to the file on the disk. Other metadata is used to store high-level information about the subdivisions
                  of the disk, such as logical volumes and partitions. This higher-level metadata and the structures it
                   represents contain the information describing the filesystem stored on the drive or partition, but
                    is separate from and independent of the filesystem metadata.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filesystems also require an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides access to system
             function calls which manipulate filesystem objects like files and directories. APIs provide for tasks
              such as creating, moving, and deleting files. It also provides algorithms that determine things like
               where a file is placed on a filesystem. Such algorithms may account for objectives such as speed or minimizing
                disk fragmentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern filesystems also provide a security model, which is a scheme for defining access
             rights to files and directories. The Linux filesystem security model helps to ensure that users only have
              access to their own files and not those of others or the operating system itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final building block is the software required to implement all of these functions.
             Linux uses a two-part software implementation as a way to improve both system and programmer efficiency.
          </p>
          <br>
          <center>

            <a style="font-size: 14px;">Figure 1: The Linux two-part filesystem software implementation.</a>
          </center>
          <br>
          <p>
            The first part of this two-part implementation is the Linux virtual filesystem.
             This virtual filesystem provides a single set of commands for the kernel,
              and developers, to access all types of filesystems. The virtual filesystem software calls the specific
               device driver required to interface to the various types of filesystems. The filesystem-specific device drivers are
                the second part of the implementation. The device driver interprets the standard set of filesystem
                 commands to ones specific to the type of filesystem on the partition or logical volume.
          </p>
          <h4 class="section__title">Directory structure</h4>
          <p>
            As a usually very organized Virgo, I like things stored in smaller, organized groups rather than in one big bucket.
             The use of directories helps me to be able to store and then locate the files I want when I am looking for them.
              Directories are also known as folders because they can be thought of as folders in which files are kept in a sort
               of physical desktop analogy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Linux and many other operating systems, directories can be structured in a tree-like hierarchy.
             The Linux directory structure is well defined and documented in the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
              Referencing those directories when accessing them is accomplished by using the sequentially deeper directory names
               connected by forward slashes (/) such as /var/log and /var/spool/mail. These are called paths.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following table provides a very brief list of the standard, well-known, and defined top-level
             Linux directories and their purposes.

          <br>
          <p>The directories and their subdirectories shown in Table 1, along with their subdirectories, that have a teal background are considered an integral part of the root filesystem. That is, they cannot be created as a separate filesystem and mounted at startup time. This is because they (specifically, their contents) must be present at boot time in order for the system to boot properly.
            The /media and /mnt directories are part of the root filesystem, but they should never contain any data. Rather, they are simply temporary mount points.
            The remaining directories, those that have no background color in Table 1 do not need to be present during the boot sequence, but will be mounted later, during the startup sequence that prepares the host to perform useful work.
            Be sure to refer to the official <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/" style="color: crimson;">Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</a> web page for details about each of these directories and their many subdirectories. Wikipedia also has a good description of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard" style="color: crimson;">FHS</a>. This standard should be followed as closely as possible to ensure operational and functional consistency. Regardless of the filesystem types used on a host, this hierarchical directory structure is the same.
          </p>
          <h4 class="section__title">Linux unified directory structure</h4>
          <p>
            In some non-Linux PC operating systems, if there are multiple physical hard drives or multiple partitions, each disk or partition is assigned a drive letter. It is necessary to know on which hard drive a file or program is located, such as C: or D:. Then you issue the drive letter as a command, D:, for example, to change to the D: drive, and then you use the cd command to change to the correct directory to locate the desired file. Each hard drive has its own separate and complete directory tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Linux filesystem unifies all physical hard drives and partitions into a single directory structure. It all starts at the top–the root (/) directory. All other directories and their subdirectories are located under the single Linux root directory. This means that there is only one single directory tree in which to search for files and programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can work only because a filesystem, such as /home, /tmp, /var, /opt, or /usr can be created on separate physical hard drives, a different partition, or a different logical volume from the / (root) filesystem and then be mounted on a mountpoint (directory) as part of the root filesystem tree. Even removable drives such as a USB thumb drive or an external USB or ESATA hard drive will be mounted onto the root filesystem and become an integral part of that directory tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            One good reason to do this is apparent during an upgrade from one version of a Linux distribution to another, or changing from one distribution to another. In general, and aside from any upgrade utilities like dnf-upgrade in Fedora, it is wise to occasionally reformat the hard drive(s) containing the operating system during an upgrade to positively remove any cruft that has accumulated over time. If /home is part of the root filesystem it will be reformatted as well and would then have to be restored from a backup. By having /home as a separate filesystem, it will be known to the installation program as a separate filesystem and formatting of it can be skipped. This can also apply to /var where database, email inboxes, website, and other variable user and system data are stored.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are other reasons for maintaining certain parts of the Linux directory tree as separate filesystems. For example, a long time ago, when I was not yet aware of the potential issues surrounding having all of the required Linux directories as part of the / (root) filesystem, I managed to fill up my home directory with a large number of very big files. Since neither the /home directory nor the /tmp directory were separate filesystems but simply subdirectories of the root filesystem, the entire root filesystem filled up. There was no room left for the operating system to create temporary files or to expand existing data files. At first, the application programs started complaining that there was no room to save files, and then the OS itself started to act very strangely. Booting to single-user mode and clearing out the offending files in my home directory allowed me to get going again. I then reinstalled Linux using a pretty standard multi-filesystem setup and was able to prevent complete system crashes from occurring again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I once had a situation where a Linux host continued to run, but prevented
             the user from logging in using the GUI desktop. I was able to log in using the
              command line interface (CLI) locally using one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console" style="color: crimson;">virtual consoles</a>, and
               remotely using SSH. The problem was that the /tmp filesystem had filled up and some temporary
                files required by the GUI desktop could not be created at login time. Because the CLI login did 
                not require files to be created in /tmp, the lack of space there did not prevent me from logging
                 in using the CLI. In this case, the /tmp directory was a separate filesystem and there was plenty of space 
                 available in the volume group the /tmp logical volume was a part of. I simply <a href="https://opensource.com/business/16/9/linux-users-guide-lvm" style="color: crimson;">expanded the /tmp logical volume</a>
                  to a size that accommodated my fresh understanding of the amount of temporary file space needed on that host
                   and the problem was solved. Note that this solution did not require a reboot, and as soon as the /tmp
                    filesystem was enlarged the user was able to login to the desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another situation occurred while I was working as a lab administrator at one large technology company. One of our developers had installed an application in the wrong location (/var). The application was crashing because the /var filesystem was full and the log files, which are stored in /var/log on that filesystem, could not be appended with new messages due to the lack of space. However, the system remained up and running because the critical / (root) and /tmp filesystems did not fill up. Removing the offending application and reinstalling it in the /opt filesystem resolved that problem.
          </p>
          <h4 class="section__title">Filesystem types</h4>
          <p>
            Linux supports reading around 100 partition types; it can create and write to only
             a few of these. But it is possible—and very common—to mount filesystems of
              different types on the same root filesystem. In this context we are talking about filesystems in terms of the
               structures and metadata required to store and manage the user data on a partition of a hard drive or a logical
                volume. The complete list of filesystem partition types recognized by the Linux fdisk command is provided here,
                 so that you can get a feel for the high degree of compatibility that Linux has with very many types of systems.

            The main purpose in supporting the ability to read so many partition types is to allow for compatibility
             and at least some interoperability with other computer systems' filesystems. The choices available when
              creating a new filesystem with Fedora are shown in the following list.

            Other distributions support creating different filesystem types. For example, CentOS 6 supports creating only those filesystems highlighted in bold in the above list.

          <h4 class="section__title">Mounting</h4>
          <p>
            The term "to mount" a filesystem in Linux refers back to the early days of computing when a tape or removable disk pack would need to be physically mounted on an appropriate drive device. After being physically placed on the drive, the filesystem on the disk pack would be logically mounted by the operating system to make the contents available for access by the OS, application programs and users.
          </p>
          <p>
            A mount point is simply a directory, like any other, that is created as part of the root filesystem. So, for example, the home filesystem is mounted on the directory /home. Filesystems can be mounted at mount points on other non-root filesystems but this is less common.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Linux root filesystem is mounted on the root directory (/) very early in the boot sequence. Other filesystems are mounted later, by the Linux startup programs, either rc under SystemV or by systemd in newer Linux releases. Mounting of filesystems during the startup process is managed by the /etc/fstab configuration file. An easy way to remember that is that fstab stands for "file system table," and it is a list of filesystems that are to be mounted, their designated mount points, and any options that might be needed for specific filesystems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filesystems are mounted on an existing directory/mount point using the mount command. In general, any directory that is used as a mount point should be empty and not have any other files contained in it. Linux will not prevent users from mounting one filesystem over one that is already there or on a directory that contains files. If you mount a filesystem on an existing directory or filesystem, the original contents will be hidden and only the content of the newly mounted filesystem will be visible.
          </p>
          <h4 class="section__title">Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            I hope that some of the possible confusion surrounding the term filesystem has been cleared up by this article. It took a long time and a very helpful mentor for me to truly understand and appreciate the complexity, elegance, and functionality of the Linux filesystem in all of its meanings.

            Another important concept is that for Linux, everything is a file. This concept has some interesting and important practical applications for users and system admins.

          <h3 class="section__title">Base Choice</h3>
          <p>
            In the previous article, we got acquainted with the Linux file system and talked a bit about its structure and how it works, because to get started, we needed to be at least familiar with the Linux file system.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, we need to base our distribution on a root file system from existing Linux distributions,
             and then develop and customize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use Ubuntu Base as the root filesystem in this guide.
             You can use other distributions root file system such as Debian , Arch , Gentoo & etc.
             Ubuntu has officially released its RootFS( Root File System ) and you can download it. For other Linux distributions such as Debian,
              you must create a root filesystem from that distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have not forgotten to say that in addition to the root file system,
             we must also download the Linux kernel and install it on the root file system.
          </p>

          I want to develop my distribution under Ubuntu Base 21.04 with amd64 architecture.
           If you want to develop your distribution for a particular architecture
            or other verson of Ubuntu Base you can get Ubuntu Base for other architectures and
